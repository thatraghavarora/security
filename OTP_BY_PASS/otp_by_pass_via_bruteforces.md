### 📄 Summary

An **OTP brute-force vulnerability** was discovered in the authentication system, where attackers can repeatedly submit OTP codes **without any rate limiting or lockout mechanism**, allowing them to guess valid OTPs and bypass the verification process.

---

### 📌 Affected Component

- OTP verification endpoint (e.g., `/verify-otp`)
- Lack of protections like rate limiting, retry limits, or CAPTCHA

---

### 🚨 Proof of Concept (PoC)

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Start the OTP verification process (e.g., during login or password reset).
2. Use a script or tool (like Burp Suite Intruder or a Python script) to send multiple requests with different OTP values (e.g., 000000 to 999999).

Example request:
```http
POST /verify-otp HTTP/1.1
Host: target-site.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "otp": "000001"
}
```

3. Continue sending requests in sequence:
   - 000001
   - 000002
   - 000003  
   ...
   - Until the correct OTP is found

4. Observe if a successful response is returned with no throttling or lockout.

**Observed Result:**

- OTP verification endpoint allows **unlimited attempts**.
- Attacker can **brute-force a 6-digit OTP** (only 1,000,000 combinations) in minutes.

**Expected Result:**

- The system should **block or throttle** after a few failed attempts and lock the session or require CAPTCHA.

---

### 🎯 Impact

- **Account Takeover:** Attackers can access user accounts without proper OTP.
- **Bypass of MFA Systems:** Undermines two-factor authentication integrity.
- **User Trust Erosion:** Users may lose confidence in platform security.
- **Regulatory Violation:** Fails to meet industry-standard MFA security requirements.

---

### 🛠️ Suggested Remediation

- Implement **rate limiting** on OTP attempts (e.g., 3-5 tries per session).
- Introduce **exponential backoff** or time delay after failed attempts.
- **Invalidate OTP** after a set number of failed tries.
- Add **CAPTCHA** after a few invalid submissions.
- Log and alert on excessive OTP attempts.

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

- OTPs should expire quickly (e.g., within 5 minutes).
- Never allow unlimited OTP attempts.
- Ensure logs track OTP failures and IP-based abuse detection.
- Use high-entropy OTPs and secure channels (e.g., SMS/Email/Authenticator App).

### 🙏 Note to Security Team / Senior Reviewer

This vulnerability exposes a critical gap in OTP validation, allowing attackers to **automate guessing attempts** and break the authentication system. Addressing this requires both server-side controls and monitoring of abusive behavior.
