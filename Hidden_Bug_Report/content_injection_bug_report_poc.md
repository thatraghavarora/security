### 🐞 Bug Report: Content Injection / Text Injection Vulnerability

**Reported By:** Raghav Arora  
**LinkedIn:** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamraghavarora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamraghavarora)  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Date Reported:** 2025-06-16

### 📄 Summary

A **content injection** (also known as **text injection**) vulnerability was discovered in the application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary text into the application’s UI, potentially misleading users, altering the interface, or setting up for further attacks like phishing or HTML injection.

---

### 📌 Affected Component

- Page content rendering in response to URL parameters or user input fields (e.g., feedback, query, name, etc.)

---

### 🚨 Proof of Concept (PoC)

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Navigate to a URL or input form that reflects user input on the page, such as:

```
https://example.com/welcome?user=Raghav
```

2. Modify the query parameter or form field to the following payload:

```
Great Hacker - Raghav Arora!
```

3. Observe how this input is directly rendered in the page without encoding.

**Result:**

The phrase `Great Hacker - Raghav Arora!` is displayed as part of the UI without sanitization, making it look like it's part of the site's original content.

---

### ✅ Expected Result

The application should treat user-controlled data as untrusted and render it safely as text, not allowing it to alter the structure or content of the interface in misleading ways.

---

### 🎯 Impact

- **Deceptive UI Content:** Attackers can make the site appear to promote or say things it does not.
- **Phishing Risk:** May be used to insert fake login notices, error messages, or brand impersonation.
- **Reputation Damage:** Defacements or misleading text can harm user trust or brand image.
- **Security Chain Attack:** In some cases, may be chained with HTML injection or reflected XSS.

---

### 🛠️ Suggested Remediation

- **Validate and encode all user-supplied content** before displaying it in the UI.
- Use contextual output encoding depending on whether the content is displayed in HTML, attributes, or scripts.
- Apply strict allow-lists for acceptable characters/inputs.
- Utilize libraries such as:
  - `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP
  - `escape()` in Python/Jinja
  - Template auto-escaping in React, Angular, Django, etc.

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Never trust client-side inputs.
- Sanitize output at the point of rendering (not just on input).
- Review all places where user input is reflected back to the client.
- Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to reduce potential impact.

### 🙏 Note to Security Team / Senior Reviewer

While this vulnerability does not directly allow script execution, it lays the foundation for **content spoofing**, **phishing attacks**, and **UI deception**. It's critical to address even basic text injection issues to maintain trust and interface integrity across the platform.
