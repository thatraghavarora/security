### 🐞 Bug Report: Missing or Misconfigured SPF Record

**Reported By:** Raghav Arora  
**LinkedIn:** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamraghavarora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamraghavarora)  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Date Reported:** 2025-06-16

### 📄 Summary

The domain is missing a properly configured **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)** record in its DNS configuration. SPF records help prevent spammers from sending emails on behalf of the domain. Without an SPF record or with a misconfigured one, attackers can spoof emails that appear to come from the affected domain.

---

### 📌 Affected Component

- DNS Configuration for the domain  
- Email security and deliverability mechanisms

---

### 🚨 Proof of Concept (PoC)

**Steps to Verify:**

1. Use an online SPF lookup tool such as:
   - https://mxtoolbox.com/spf.aspx
   - https://easydmarc.com/tools/spf-lookup

2. Enter the domain name and observe the SPF record results.

**Observed Result:**

- No SPF record found  
**OR**  
- SPF record is present but does not include all authorized sending services (e.g., mail servers, third-party email tools).

Example response:

```
No SPF Record found
```

**Expected Result:**

- A valid SPF record should be published in the DNS TXT record for the domain.

Example:

```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

---

### 🎯 Impact

- Enables attackers to **spoof emails** from the domain.
- Increases the likelihood of **phishing, spam, or email-based fraud**.
- Reduces **email deliverability** and may cause legitimate emails to be marked as spam.
- May damage domain reputation with email providers.

---

### 🛠️ Suggested Remediation

- Publish a valid SPF record in the domain’s DNS settings.
- The SPF record should list all IPs and domains authorized to send email on behalf of the domain.

**Example SPF Record:**

```
v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 include:_spf.google.com -all
```

- Use tools like EasyDMARC, MXToolbox, or your DNS provider’s wizard to correctly configure SPF.

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Always configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC together for email authentication.
- Monitor SPF record changes and maintain a list of authorized senders.
- Use "-all" or "~all" based on policy strictness:
  - `-all` = hard fail (recommended)
  - `~all` = soft fail
