### 🐞 Bug Report: Missing Security Headers

**Reported By:** Raghav Arora

**Severity:** Medium

### 📄 Summary

The application is missing several important **HTTP security headers** in its server responses. These headers play a crucial role in protecting the website and its users from a wide range of attacks, including **clickjacking**, **MIME sniffing**, **XSS**, and **man-in-the-middle** attacks.

---

### 📌 Affected Component

- Web server response headers on all or specific endpoints

---

### 🚨 Proof of Concept (PoC)

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Use a tool such as `curl`, `Burp Suite`, or an online scanner like [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com).
2. Send a request to the application:

   ```bash
   curl -I https://example.com
   ```

3. Observe the lack of essential headers in the response.

**Missing Headers Example:**

```
Strict-Transport-Security: MISSING
Content-Security-Policy: MISSING
X-Frame-Options: MISSING
X-Content-Type-Options: MISSING
Referrer-Policy: MISSING
Permissions-Policy: MISSING
```

---

### 🎯 Impact

Without these headers, the application becomes vulnerable to:

- **Clickjacking attacks** (no `X-Frame-Options`)
- **MIME-type confusion** (no `X-Content-Type-Options`)
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks** (no `Strict-Transport-Security`)
- **Referrer data leakage** (no `Referrer-Policy`)
- **Browser feature abuse** (no `Permissions-Policy`)
- **XSS injection vectors** (no `Content-Security-Policy`)

---

### 🛠️ Suggested Remediation

Add the following security headers to server responses:

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=()
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Apply security headers globally and review them regularly.
- Use a web application firewall (WAF) or CDN to enforce headers if server changes are limited.
- Regularly scan endpoints to ensure no headers are missing.

### 🙏 Note to Security Team / Developers

Security headers are a low-effort, high-impact defense mechanism. They should be considered essential in all environments, including development and staging, to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of production oversights.
