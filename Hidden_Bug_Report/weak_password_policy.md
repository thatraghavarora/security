**Severity:** High  
**Date Reported:** 2025-06-16

### 📄 Summary

The application accepts **weak passwords** during user registration or password change, lacking a robust password policy. This increases the risk of account takeover via brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.

---

### 📌 Affected Component

- User Registration Form  
- Password Reset / Change Functionality  
- Authentication System

---

### 🚨 Proof of Concept (PoC)

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Go to the user registration or password change page.
2. Enter weak passwords such as:
   - `123456`
   - `password`
   - `qwerty`
   - `admin`
3. Submit the form.

**Observed Result:**

- The application allows submission and acceptance of these weak passwords without any warning or rejection.

**Expected Result:**

- The system should enforce a **strong password policy**, rejecting weak or commonly used passwords.

---

### 🎯 Impact

- Makes user accounts highly susceptible to:
  - **Brute-force attacks**
  - **Credential stuffing**
  - **Dictionary attacks**
- Can lead to:
  - Unauthorized account access
  - Data breaches
  - Reputational and legal risks

---

### 🛠️ Suggested Remediation

- Enforce a **strong password policy**:
  - Minimum 8–12 characters
  - At least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one special character
- Check passwords against **common password lists** (e.g., using HaveIBeenPwned API).
- Provide users with **password strength indicators** during input.
- Implement **rate-limiting and MFA** to reduce brute-force risk.

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Always hash passwords using modern hashing algorithms like **bcrypt**, **Argon2**, or **PBKDF2**.
- Do not store passwords in plain text.
- Regularly audit and update password policies in accordance with **OWASP** guidelines.

### 🙏 Note to Security Team

Password strength is the first line of defense in account security. A weak password policy can severely compromise the security posture of the application. It is crucial to implement and enforce proper password complexity and length requirements to prevent unauthorized access.
