**Reported By:** Raghav Arora

### 📄 Summary

The application interface has a **text overflow bug**, where long text input (e.g., user names, product names, messages) is not properly handled. This causes layout breaking, overlapping UI components, or horizontal scrolling issues on smaller screens.

---

### 📌 Affected Component

- Frontend UI Elements:
  - User profile section
  - Notification/messages panel
  - Product cards/listings
  - Table or grid views

---

### 🚨 Proof of Concept (PoC)

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Enter a long string into a form field or user profile:
   ```text
   ThisIsAVeryLongUsernameWithoutAnySpacesThatCanBreakTheLayout1234567890
   ```

2. Submit or view the profile/page where this value is rendered.

**Observed Result:**

- Text spills out of the container.
- No ellipsis (`...`) or wrapping applied.
- Layout breaks or horizontal scroll appears.

**Expected Result:**

- Long text should be truncated with ellipsis or wrapped gracefully.
- UI should remain intact across screen sizes.

---

### 🎯 Impact

- Poor user experience and unprofessional UI presentation.
- Mobile or small-screen users may find interface **unusable**.
- May obscure other important UI elements like buttons or inputs.
- Could enable **UI redress** if injected with crafted long text (e.g., phishing via names/emails).

---

### 🛠️ Suggested Remediation

Apply the following CSS to vulnerable containers or text elements:

```css
overflow: hidden;
text-overflow: ellipsis;
white-space: nowrap;
```

Or, to allow wrapping instead:

```css
word-break: break-word;
white-space: normal;
```

Use container constraints with `max-width`, `min-width`, and `responsive design` principles (Flexbox/Grid).

---

### 🔒 Best Practices

- Always sanitize and constrain UI content length.
- Use frontend libraries/frameworks that enforce **UI constraints** (e.g., Material UI, Bootstrap).
- Test responsive UI across devices and orientations.

### 🙏 Note to Developers / UI Team

While this is not a security vulnerability, it affects **usability and interface reliability**. Ensuring consistent display across various user inputs is essential for a polished and professional user experience.
